### Day-to-Day Approach (PST)

10:00am - Standup Meeting (Scrum) - each morning, meet for 15-30 minutes regarding:

* Review - PM tool
* What they did the day prior
* What they were having roadblocks on yesterday
* What they plan on doing today

10:30-12:00pm - Stand-up - Remo/mic-off

12:00pm-1:00pm - Lunch break

1:00-6:00pm - Stand-up - Remo/mic-off

After-hours anticipated, but not required/expected.

## Conflict Plan

**Resolving Conflict:** Addressing directly one-on-one is preferred.

**If someone is taking over the project:** Bring it up during stand-up meetings, tell them what you are noticing.

**If someone is not contributing enough:** Ask them to step it up, ask if there is something they need to be successful.

**If conflict needs escalating:** Bring to group level first, and if again that does not work, speak with Jacob about the issue.

## Communication Plan

**Hours of Availability:** 10:00am - 6:00pm (PST) core hours, 6:00am - 9:00pm extended hours

**Communication Platforms:** Slack, Remo, Zoom, Trello

**Breaks:** 1:00pm - 2:00pm lunch, suggested 10 minute break on the hour

**Falling behind schedule:** Mandatory overtime, or picking up others’ slack if possible and asking for help - utilize TA’s, other group members. Regroup and reevaluate scope if necessary (_last resort_).

**After Hours/Weekend/Mics-Off Communication:** Slack

**Voicing Concerns:** Scrum meetings twice/day, remo working sessions

**Environment Safety:** Accepting others for who they are, ensuring everyone has an opportunity to speak and feels heard/like a contributor, keeping snark in check, focusing on creating positive team environment, No micromanaging

**During sprints:**If working individually and a question comes up, DM _one (1)_ teammate instead of going on-mic or messaging the whole group. If working with a TA, move to another table before submitting a ticket.

## Work Plan

**Task Identification:**

Use Github Project Boards for clarifying and assigning tasks, and keep up to date with project

Identify daily goals in stand-up meetings

* Reiterate features to be worked on, who will work on them

Separate Markdown file for id’s, classes, etc. used in project

**Pick two features for pair programming** - decide during stand-up meetings which features / pairs

**Project management:**Trello kanban board

## Git Process

**Stored on GitHub:**

* All files/assets directly related to the website will be uploaded to project repo
* Documents that cannot be uploaded directly to the repo (such as this document) will be linked via the projects about me page.

**Repo Access:** All members as owners/collaborators

**Git Flow:**

* All changes on feature branches, no direct pushes to main
* Branches should be named based on features
* Feature branches initially will be very broad, and then become more specific to smaller features of the project.
* Commit message format: “Implements/Adds/Debugs/Begins someFunc() method of User obj for user alert feature”
* Pull request names should be formatted like commit messages
  * Add notes in the description for other devs

**PR Reviews:**

* **How many people must review a PR:** Two (2)
* **Who Merges PRs**: Reviewer
* **Merge Frequency:**After feature completion
* **Merge Communication**: Submit Github PR review request, and notify group via Slack

Pair vs solo:

If someone wants to work on a specific feature with someone else, they can do that.

Otherwise mostly solo production.
