# Vacation Ratings

This application is our version of a vacation rating website. There will be Authentication where users can create & sign into their own accounts and add their own ratings to a aggregated collection of ratings for a given location.

## This project:
* Allows users to add a description of their stay at a location. This includes their duration of stay, description of overall experience, as well as expenses, and a rating / 10.
* Other users will be able to query locations and see the corresponding average rating of said location and add their own review as well, if applicable.

## Problem Domain:
* Provides a site where people can see aggregated reviews for a location.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* This project should:
    * Allow people to query a location
    * Allow people to add a review to a location
    * Allow people to add a rating to a location
    * Allow people to sign in (persisting data)
    * Carosel to display random trip reviews on main page

* Stretch goals:
    * Add images to locations when a user submits a review
    * Add Yelp API to see what is in the area of the location
    * (VRBO API)
    * (Airline API to see price of tickets)
